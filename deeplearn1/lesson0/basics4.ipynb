    "Disk space for Amazon EC2 works a lot like disk space for regular VMs in the sense that there is something roughly equivalent to a `vmdk` or `vdi` that's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Amazon EC2 easy to understand is that similar to having VMs on your external hard drive, the hard disk for an Amazon EC2 instance effectively lives on an external system referred to as Elastic Block Store.\n",

    "https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\n",

    "\n",
    "https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/\n",
    "\n",
    "As you run a virtual machine on your local machine, bits of it get loaded into main memory. Similarly, an EC2 instance volume lives in cloud storage (conceptually similar to an Amazon S3 bucket). As the virtual machine runs and asks for files, fragments of that volume transfer to the machine itself."

    "At any time, you can take a snapshot of the volumes for a running (or ideally, shutdown) virtual machine. These snapshots allow you to create something called an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).\n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly touched on this in the introduction to this notebook series, but basically, an Amazon Machine Image is a backup of a volume that can be used as a starting point for a virtual machine. It might be as simple as an operating system, where you can do as much as you want and start over, or it can be complex as a complete database installation, where you can create a brand new snapshot so that you don't have to redo any work.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMIs are stored in Amazon S3. This means that if you take a snapshot, you incur the costs of S3 storage in order to maintain that AMI. These costs are separate from the costs of the volumes in Elastic Block Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonS3.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that AMIs originate in S3 explains why creating a snapshot of a large database on Amazon EC2 and restoring it is extremely slow. It's because you're effectively streaming the database volume from Amazon S3 to Amazon EBS, and then from Amazon EBS back to your requested EC2 instance."

    "These block devices are referred to as ephemeral storage because all data on this is lost if the server is ever shut down (the exception being a reboot that isn't a formal shut down). Therefore, while it is recommended that you at least ask for these volumes if you spin up a new virtual machine, be careful about storing data here if you plan on shutting down the server."
